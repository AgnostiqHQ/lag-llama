* **Coming Next**: Detailed Fine-tuning Tutorial with examples on real-world datasets and best practices in using Lag-Llama! (Coming ~~by end of March~~ soon)

<b>Updates</b>:

* **5-Apr-2024**: Added a [section](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DRAzLUPxsd-0r8b-o4nlyFXrjw_ZajJJ?authuser=1#scrollTo=Mj9LXMpJ01d7&line=6&uniqifier=1) in Colab Demo 1 on the importance of tuning the context length for zero-shot forecasting. Added a best practices section in the README.
* **4-Apr-2024**: We have updated our requirements file with new versions of certain packages. Please update/recreate your environments if you have previously used the code locally.
* **7-Mar-2024**: We have released a preliminary [Colab Demo 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uvTmh-pe1zO5TeaaRVDdoEWJ5dFDI-pA?usp=sharing) for finetuning, while we prepare a detailed tutorial. Please note this is preliminary and cannot be used for benchmarking. A detailed demo with instructions for benchmarking is coming soon along with the tutorial. 
* **17-Feb-2024**: We have released a new updated [Colab Demo 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DRAzLUPxsd-0r8b-o4nlyFXrjw_ZajJJ?usp=sharing) for zero-shot forecasting that shows how one can load time series of different formats.
* **7-Feb-2024**: We released Lag-Llama, with open-source model checkpoints and a Colab Demo for zero-shot forecasting.

## Best Practices

Here are some general tips in using Lag-Llama. 
<!-- We recommend reading the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08278) for all details about the model. -->

### General Information

* Lag-Llama is a **probabilistic** forecasting model trained to output a probability distribution for each timestep to be predicted. For your own specific use-case, we would recommend benchmarking the zero-shot performance of the model on your data first, and then finetuning if necessary. As we show in our paper, Lag-Llama has strong zero-shot capabilities, but performs best when finetuned. The more data you finetune on, the better. For specific tips on applying on model zero-shot or on finetuning, please refer to the sections below.

#### Zero-Shot Forecasting

* Importantly, we recommend trying different **context lengths** (starting from $32$ which it was trained on) and identifying what works best for your data. As we show in [this section of the zero-shot forecasting demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DRAzLUPxsd-0r8b-o4nlyFXrjw_ZajJJ?authuser=1#scrollTo=Mj9LXMpJ01d7&line=6&uniqifier=1), the model's zero-shot performance improves as the context length is increased, until a certain context length which may be specific to your data. Further, we recommend enabling RoPE scaling for the model to work well with context lengths larger than what it was trained on.
